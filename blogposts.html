            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>See a skin care expert</strong></span></p><p><br></p><p>The easiest way to choose the right anti-aging skin care for your skin is to consult an expert. Developing a relationship with a trusted aesthetician can help you see major improvements in your skin and also prevent future damage.
</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">&nbsp;We asked our skin care experts to weigh in on how they choose the proper treatments and take home skin care for you:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">"Research has shown that people in their 20's want to look better in selfies and pictures and want to see instant results. Fines lines will be high on their list of concerns. Since the damage isn't usually as deep with this age group, I focus on making sure they follow the proper daily routine with one anti-aging product in the mix if they need it, along with regular Custom Blend Facials," says – Alina Houtz, Licensed Aesthetician, Jordan Thomas Salon &amp; Spa. "It's crucial to start a daily routine of cleansing, toning and moisturizing twice daily, but most importantly applying a broad spectrum sunscreen every morning! If they still suffer from fine lines or other aging concerns, I usually recommend adding Age Activist Clinical Youth Serum or Plump Start to give them an extra boost and added preventative care. People in their 40's and up typically want to see improvement on fine lines, deep wrinkles, age spots, loss of firmness, etc. They may also be interested in slowing the aging process. Be strategic when developing a treatment plan with your client. Start with the concern that bothers him/her the most and progress from there with a combination of professional treatments and at-home care. </span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Quick Refiner for Eyes, Plump Start, Skin Editor and LightPlex GigaWatt Dark Spot Corrector are just a few great choices that I tend to gravitate towards for this age group and these concerns. Gentle chemical peels are also a great treatment for treating some deeper damage. Ages 60 and up typically want to see improvement in the overall health of their skin. This group will be looking for your professional recommendations for a complete at-home skin care regimen and treatment schedule. Skin Editor is above and beyond my favorite for this age group!"&nbsp;</span><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>How to choose anti-aging product: Make it work with your lifestyle&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">"There are a plethora of wonderful anti-aging products from Bioelements, but no one expects you to use every single one in your routine – it all depends on your lifestyle and your skin concerns. Are you a skin care junkie? Add several anti-aging products into your daily routine. Don't have the time or patience for a lengthy routine? Opt for an all-in-one anti-ager like Skin Editor or Age Activist Clinical Youth Serum. That being said, anti-aging prevention in the form of a daily broad spectrum sunscreen should start at a very young age, regardless of lifestyle, skin type, etc."  –Nina Holt, Esthetician,Westwood Studio and Spa</span></p></blockquote><blockquote>"The first thing you should evaluate is your skin type and the products you are currently using. Then follow with asking yourself what are the areas on your face that truly concern you. I recommend focusing on your top 1-3 concerns instead of trying every product under the sun. " –Tina Martinez, Licensed Esthetician,Flawless Beauty By Tina<br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>How to choose anti-aging product: Identify your biggest skin goals</strong><br></blockquote><blockquote>"When you start looking for anti-aging products, always ask yourself what your specific skin care goals are first. 'Anti-aging' can be a broad term and may mean something different to you versus someone else. When you look in the mirror what is the first thing you notice? Fine lines under your eyes? Try an eye creme like Sleepwear for Eyes. Dull, lackluster skin? Opt for Radiance Rescue to rev skin up for instant glow. There's no one-size-fits-all solution.
</blockquote><blockquote>However, I do always recommending starting with the appropriate cleanser, toner, and SPF. When the skin is balanced, it is able to get the full benefits from any anti-aging skin care that you use." –Tricia Koch, Licensed Esthetician, Solei Day Spa<br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The right anti-aging products for you</strong><br></blockquote><blockquote>These are the most common anti-aging skin concerns and the top products to treat them. Click on each individual product to read reviews, see what skin types it is suited for, and to learn more about the formula. How many products you incorporate into your routine depends entirely on your lifestyle, severity of your concerns, and your preferences:
</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles</strong><br></blockquote><blockquote>Both natural aging and everyday actions cause fine lines and deep wrinkles to form. Prevent them by wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen daily and tackle them with these products if they have already formed:<br></blockquote><blockquote>Skin Editor is an imperfection-editing leave on AHA peel creme that works to erase long-term damage to dramatically reduce the look of lines<br></blockquote><blockquote>Age Activist Clinical Youth Serum is an all-in-one serum that uses clinical-strength retinol, peptides, CoQ10 and fermented pumpkin to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
</blockquote><blockquote>Plump Start delivers intelligent hydration to visually improve the look of skin's wrinkle valleys and crevices and scavenges skin-aging free radicals for long-term improvement
</blockquote><blockquote>Radiance Rescue wakes up skin's microcirculation so you emerge glowing and less lined
</blockquote><blockquote>Collagen Rehab helps lines look filled so wrinkle appearance improves and skin looks instantly renewed and dewy
</blockquote><blockquote>Sleepwear and Oil Control Sleepwear both work overnight to smooth the appearance of lines and wrinkles as it dramatically improves moisture and tone
</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Sagging &amp; Loss of Volume</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Forget the needles and lasers. Today there are effective skin care solutions to firm and tighten the appearance of sagging skin:<br></blockquote><blockquote>Plump Start uses an intensive plumping concentrate to deliver instant youthful fullness<br></blockquote><blockquote>Collagen Rehab uses amino acids to help support collagen and elastin performance – so lines appear filled, skin looks firmer, and acts years younger.
</blockquote><blockquote>Age Activist Clinical Youth Serum creates a smoother complexion (both on the face and neck + chest)
</blockquote><blockquote>Multi-Task Eye Creme eases the lines brought on by sagging and helps skin feel firmer
</blockquote><blockquote>Sleepwear and Oil Control Sleepwear's dream team formula works overnight to reclaim firmness
</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Crows Feet &amp; Dark Under Eye Circles</strong></blockquote><blockquote>The skin around the eyes is the thinnest on your body – It's the area of the face that most often shows the first signs of aging, and is prone to dark circles and fine lines. Protect delicate skin with these targeted under eye treatments:<br></blockquote><blockquote>Radiance Rescue helps increase skin's elasticity and moisturization to reduce the look of lines and puffiness around the eyes<br></blockquote><blockquote>Sleepwear for Eyes works while you sleep to moisturize and nourish this thin fragile skin to target crows feet, smooth surface lines and improve wrinkle length and depth
</blockquote><blockquote>Multi-Task Eye Creme is a light and non-greasy daytime eye creme designed to brighten, target puffiness and ease fine lines
</blockquote><blockquote>Sensitive Eye Smoother is a gentle formula for delicate skin smoothes texture, minimizes puff, brightens circles and helps defend against irritants
</blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;<strong>Age Spots</strong></blockquote><blockquote>
Over time, UV damage can lead to the production of solar lentigines (also known as "age spots" or "liver spots"). Wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen will help prevent further dark spots and protect the results you've gotten from treatments, but to truly tackle age spots use the following:
</blockquote><blockquote>Skin Editor edits skin imperfections and helps brighten dark damage<br></blockquote><blockquote>LightPlex MegaWatt Skin Brightener is an antioxidant skin brightening cream that brightens and evens all over for luminous, hydrated skin</blockquote><blockquote>LightPlex GigaWatt Dark Spot Corrector pinpoints and obliterates stubborn, isolated age spots, discoloration, UV damage, and signs of past acne with this lightning-fast formula</blockquote></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>When I first learned to perform professional facials more than two decades ago it was with a "hands-off"approach (sounds unbelievable but it's true.)  We were taught to never let the skin redden…keep it calm and soothed. Don't rock the boat! Then I met my mentor who taught me just the opposite. "The fountain of youth is in the bloodstream," "Challenge the skin,"  "Don't sedate, stimulate."
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong><br></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>This stimulation is accomplished by massage of the face, neck and shoulders. Facial massage naturally drains away accumulated toxins, boosts collagen production, and tones the skin. Circulation is also revved-up by the application of highly active professional treatment products. To me, this is the main reason to get monthly facials. The ultra-stimulation of skin simply cannot be duplicated at home. No way.
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong><br></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Now that doesn't mean you'll exit the facial room with beet red, burning skin. On the contrary, a licensed esthetician is taught to rev-up the skin, deep cleanse it and then calm it back down. It's not about the relaxation factor (though that's a wonderful side effect) or miraculous de-aging…it's about "helping the skin help itself." Increased blood flow to the skin carries oxygen in and drives toxins out. This in turn promotes firmer, clearer, younger-looking skin. How can you go wrong?
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong><br></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>So I'm off to get my monthly facial. After all, I want to keep getting those ego-boosting comments about how great my skin looks. But before I go, I've got a quick question for you. Have you made regular facial treatments a part of your skin care program?</strong></span></p><p><br></p><p>One of the first-ever licensed estheticians in the U.S., Barbara Salomone is the architect of the modern American facial. Since launching Bioelements Professional Skin Care in 1991, she has trailblazed the industry, incorporating nutritional supplements into topical skin care products, and pioneering the introduction of antioxidants, calcium, probiotics and lutein.</p></blockquote></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Review of the scientific literature shows us that oncology massage helps improve the quality of life of those who are currently or have previously gone through cancer treatment.  Benefits include improved relaxation, sleep, and immune function as well as relieving anxiety, pain, fatigue and nausea. Oncology massage therapists are trained to meet people where they are in their experience with cancer and apply a highly individualized massage treatment to comfort, nurture and support them in their process. &nbsp;</span><br></p><p></p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>The treatments are modified according to the full spectrum of cancer-related issues: the physical, psycho-social and emotional consequences of cancer. In addition, the person's individual goals are considered and aspects of the disease and cancer treatment side effects.
</p><p></p><p>
Personal goals for receiving oncology massage can include the desire for a respite - a relaxing pleasurable experience in the midst of everything that is going on - relieving nausea or other symptoms such as pain or peripheral neuropathy and helping them get though the remainder of their cancer treatments.
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>"Getting massages from someone who understands everything that is going on, is part of my healing process" &nbsp;Tom, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer almost three years ago and receives massage therapy at the Integrative Medicine Center. </p><p><br></p><p>In the past, therapists thought massage would increase circulation and therefore cause cancer to spread.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">The process of metastasis is very complicated and poorly understood; however increased circulation is not considered a significant part of that process.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">However, it's true that cancer and cancer treatments can put people at risk for complications from massage, so it is important to take some precautions. Because of the different contraindications for massage in this population, it is very important for the massage therapist who is treating a person with a history of cancer - either currently or in the past - to have specialized training in oncology massage, in addition to being a licensed massage therapist.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote></div>
